Description: Do not allow pcap_loop to be interrupted by signals
 Allowing pcap_loop to be interrupted by external signals causes segfaults
 on i386 architectures.
 This patch makes the Net::Pcap (0.16) module behave the same way as its
 previous release.
 Upstream is working on it since this feature can be useful for some people.
