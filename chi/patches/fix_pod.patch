Description: 
 * Fix several typos in CHI and CHI::Driver::Development PODs.
 * Fix CHI::Driver::Base::CacheContainer's POD to have a proper
   NAME section with a short description after the class name, so
   pod2man generates proper man pages.
 * Fix CHI::Driver::MetaCache's POD to have a proper
   NAME section with a short description after the class name, so
   pod2man generates proper man pages.
